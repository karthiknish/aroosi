# Profile Creation Validation Enhancement Requirements

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for enhancing the validation and error handling in the profile creation modal to provide a more robust and user-friendly experience. The current implementation has basic validation but needs improvements in error messaging, field validation, and user guidance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Enhanced Field Validation

**User Story:** As a user filling out the profile creation form, I want clear, immediate feedback on field validation so that I can correct errors before proceeding.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters invalid data in any field THEN the system SHALL display a clear, specific error message below the field
2. WHEN a user corrects an invalid field THEN the system SHALL immediately clear the error message
3. WHEN a user leaves a required field empty THEN the system SHALL show a "This field is required" message
4. WHEN a user enters data that doesn't match the expected format THEN the system SHALL show format-specific guidance
5. IF a field has character limits THEN the system SHALL show a character counter and validation message

### Requirement 2: Step-by-Step Validation

**User Story:** As a user progressing through the profile creation steps, I want to be prevented from advancing with incomplete or invalid data so that I don't waste time on later steps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Next" on any step THEN the system SHALL validate all required fields for that step
2. IF validation fails THEN the system SHALL prevent navigation and highlight all invalid fields
3. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL show a summary of errors at the top of the form
4. WHEN a user fixes all validation errors THEN the system SHALL automatically enable the "Next" button
5. IF a step has no required fields THEN the system SHALL allow progression without validation

### Requirement 3: Comprehensive Error Messages

**User Story:** As a user encountering validation errors, I want helpful, actionable error messages so that I know exactly how to fix the issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a validation error occurs THEN the system SHALL display human-readable error messages
2. WHEN an error message is shown THEN it SHALL include specific guidance on how to fix the issue
3. WHEN multiple errors exist THEN the system SHALL prioritize and show the most critical error first
4. WHEN a network error occurs THEN the system SHALL show a retry option with clear instructions
5. WHEN a server error occurs THEN the system SHALL provide fallback options or contact information

### Requirement 4: Real-time Validation Feedback

**User Story:** As a user typing in form fields, I want immediate feedback on my input so that I can correct mistakes as I type.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types in a field THEN the system SHALL validate the input after a 500ms delay
2. WHEN validation passes THEN the system SHALL show a subtle success indicator
3. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL show the error without disrupting typing
4. WHEN a user focuses on a field with an error THEN the system SHALL show helpful placeholder text
5. IF a field has specific format requirements THEN the system SHALL show format examples

### Requirement 5: Progress Validation

**User Story:** As a user completing the profile creation process, I want to see my progress and understand what's still required so that I can complete the form efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is on any step THEN the system SHALL show which fields are complete vs incomplete
2. WHEN a user has completed all required fields for a step THEN the system SHALL show a completion indicator
3. WHEN a user tries to submit the final form THEN the system SHALL validate all required fields across all steps
4. IF any required fields are missing THEN the system SHALL navigate to the first incomplete step and highlight missing fields
5. WHEN the profile is successfully created THEN the system SHALL show a clear success message and next steps

### Requirement 6: Error Recovery

**User Story:** As a user who encounters errors during profile creation, I want clear recovery options so that I don't lose my progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a network error occurs during submission THEN the system SHALL preserve all form data and offer retry
2. WHEN a server error occurs THEN the system SHALL save progress locally and provide recovery options
3. WHEN a user refreshes the page THEN the system SHALL restore their progress from local storage
4. WHEN an authentication error occurs THEN the system SHALL preserve form data and re-authenticate
5. IF the modal is accidentally closed THEN the system SHALL restore the user's progress when reopened

### Requirement 7: Accessibility and Usability

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the validation system to work with screen readers and keyboard navigation so that I can complete the form independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL announce errors to screen readers
2. WHEN a user navigates with keyboard THEN error messages SHALL be properly associated with form fields
3. WHEN errors are displayed THEN they SHALL have sufficient color contrast and not rely solely on color
4. WHEN a user focuses on an invalid field THEN the error message SHALL be read by screen readers
5. IF a user is using high contrast mode THEN error indicators SHALL remain visible and clear
